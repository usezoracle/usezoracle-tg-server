# Quickstart Guide

Get up and running with the UseZoracle API in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- API credentials from Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests
- A tool to make API calls (like curl, Postman, or a programming language)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

To use the UseZoracle API, you'll need to set up your CDP credentials:

```bash
# Required environment variables for the API
CDP_API_KEY_ID=your-api-key-id
CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=your-api-key-secret
CDP_WALLET_SECRET=your-wallet-secret
```

## Step 2: Create an Account

First, let's create a new cryptocurrency account:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://usezoracle-telegrambot-production.up.railway.app/api/accounts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-first-account"}'
```

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "address": "0x...",
    "name": "my-first-account",
    "network": "base"
  },
  "message": "Account my-first-account created successfully"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Step 3: Check Your Balance

Now, let's check the token balances for your new account:

```bash
curl "https://usezoracle-telegrambot-production.up.railway.app/api/balances/my-first-account"
```

## Step 4: Make a Transfer

Finally, let's transfer some tokens:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://usezoracle-telegrambot-production.up.railway.app/api/transactions/transfer" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "accountName": "my-first-account",
    "to": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    "amount": "0.001",
    "token": "eth",
    "network": "base"
  }'
```
