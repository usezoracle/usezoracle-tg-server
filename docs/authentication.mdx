# Authentication

The UseZoracle API uses CDP (Coinbase Developer Platform) credentials for authentication.

## CDP Credentials

To use the UseZoracle API, you need three key pieces of information:

1. **CDP_API_KEY_ID**: Your API key identifier
2. **CDP_API_KEY_SECRET**: Your API key secret
3. **CDP_WALLET_SECRET**: Your wallet secret for signing transactions

These credentials should be kept secure and never exposed in client-side code.

## Server Configuration

The UseZoracle API server needs these credentials to be configured as environment variables:

```bash
CDP_API_KEY_ID=your-api-key-id
CDP_API_KEY_SECRET=your-api-key-secret
CDP_WALLET_SECRET=your-wallet-secret
```

<Warning>
Never include these credentials in client-side code or expose them in your frontend applications.
</Warning>

## Obtaining Credentials

To obtain CDP credentials:

1. Create an account on [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
4. Generate a wallet secret for transaction signing

## Error Messages

If you see the following error message, your CDP credentials are not properly configured:

```
Missing required CDP Secret API Key configuration parameters.
```

Make sure your environment variables are correctly set up before using the API.

## Security Best Practices

To keep your integration secure:

- Store credentials in environment variables
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Use secure, encrypted connections for all API calls
