# Token Approvals Guide

When executing swaps, you need to approve the Permit2 contract to spend your tokens before the swap can be executed.

## What is Token Approval?

Token approval is a security feature in ERC-20 tokens that requires you to explicitly give permission to a smart contract (in this case, the Permit2 contract) to spend your tokens on your behalf.

## The Permit2 Contract

- **Contract Address**: `0x000000000022d473030f116ddee9f6b43ac78ba3`
- **Purpose**: Handles token approvals for swaps
- **Network**: Base (and other supported networks)

## How to Approve Tokens

### Method 1: Using a Wallet Interface

1. **Connect your wallet** to the Base network
2. **Navigate to the token** you want to swap
3. **Find the "Approve" or "Allow" function**
4. **Enter the Permit2 contract address**: `0x000000000022d473030f116ddee9f6b43ac78ba3`
5. **Set the approval amount** (the amount you want to swap or higher for future swaps)
6. **Confirm the transaction**

### Method 2: Using Etherscan/BaseScan

1. **Go to BaseScan**: https://basescan.org/
2. **Find your token contract**
3. **Go to the "Contract" tab**
4. **Click "Write Contract"**
5. **Connect your wallet**
6. **Call the `approve` function**:
   - `spender`: `0x000000000022d473030f116ddee9f6b43ac78ba3`
   - `amount`: The amount you want to approve (in wei/smallest unit)

## Common Errors and Solutions

### Error: "Insufficient token allowance for swap"

**Cause**: The Permit2 contract doesn't have permission to spend your tokens.

**Solution**: Approve the Permit2 contract to spend your tokens.

### Error: "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"

**Cause**: You're trying to swap more tokens than you have.

**Solution**: Check your token balance and reduce the swap amount.

### Error: "Insufficient balance to execute the transaction"

**Cause**: You don't have enough ETH to pay for gas fees.

**Solution**: Add some ETH to your wallet for gas fees.

## Important Notes

- **Native ETH**: No approval is required for native ETH swaps
- **Approval Amount**: You can approve more than you need for future swaps
- **Gas Fees**: Approval transactions require gas fees
- **One-time Setup**: Once approved, you can swap that token without re-approving (unless you exceed the approved amount)

## Example Approval Process

1. **Check your token balance**
2. **Approve the Permit2 contract** for the amount you want to swap
3. **Wait for approval transaction** to be confirmed
4. **Execute your swap** using the API

## Security Considerations

- **Only approve trusted contracts**: The Permit2 contract is safe to approve
- **Review approval amounts**: Don't approve more than necessary
- **Revoke approvals**: You can revoke approvals by setting the amount to 0
- **Monitor transactions**: Always review transactions before confirming
